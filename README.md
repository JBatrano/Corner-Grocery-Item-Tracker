Reflective Insights:

What I did particularly well:
The success of the project is largely owed to the menu-driven interface, which I designed to be both intuitive and accommodating for users. Keeping the needs of Corner Grocer staff in mind, I developed the software to be straightforward, ensuring that users could navigate the features without any technical hiccups.

Enhancements & Improvements:
In future iterations, I plan to add an inventory restock recommendation feature. By analyzing item purchase rates, this feature would suggest optimal restocking intervals and quantities for Corner Grocer. Implementing additional security mechanisms, like data encryption, is also on the roadmap to enhance data security.

Challenges:
One of the most demanding tasks was constructing the function that searched for specific item frequencies. Striving for both accuracy and speed, I experimented with various C++ data structures and algorithms. I also turned to C++ communities online to glean best practices, which guided my implementation.

Support Network:
This project expanded my understanding of C++ and exposed me to several insightful resources. From C++ documentation to online developer communities, I have a broader and more refined set of tools at my disposal for future coding challenges.

Transferable Skills:
The skills I nurtured during this project, such as building efficient menu-driven interfaces and managing file exports in C++, will undoubtedly be invaluable for subsequent projects that require similar functionalities.

Maintainability, Readability, & Adaptability:
My commitment to code clarity is evident in the project's structure. The code is organized into distinct functions, generously commented, and laid out logically, ensuring it's both easy to comprehend and primed for future modifications.
